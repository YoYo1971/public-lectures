Thanks to the generosity and support of JADS, I can happily share the vast majority of my teaching materials as [free cultural works](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/). These teaching materials are available in the following public locations:

- [This GitHub repository](https://github.com/jads-nl/public-lectures), which includes Jupyter Notebooks, files, reading material and pdf versions of the lecture notes.
- Various GitHub repositories with data science projects and challenges to be used in conjunction with the lectures:
  - [Discovery project](https://github.com/jads-nl/discovery-projects), a selection of ‘toy datasets’ suitable for beginners
  - 'Execute projects' meant for more intermediate classes:
    - https://github.com/jads-nl/execute-enexis
    - https://github.com/jads-nl/execute-nhs-proms
    - https://github.com/jads-nl/execute-wmo-voorspelmodel
- A [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vq3r0caQL9t36dJmrlsg5VN9f2zqxWdq?usp=sharing) which contains most recent (working) version of the lecture notes and other working documents.
- A Kumu project, [the Tree of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://kumu.io/jads/tree-of-machine-learning-algorithms), to be used in class to guide students in the enormous wealth of machine learning libraries in various programming languages.
- A [Zotero bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2355280/jads/library), which contains relevant journal papers that can be offered as further reading to the participants. Open access journal papers are directly accessible (via a link). Closed access journal papers are referenced with an URL to a private Google Drive.
